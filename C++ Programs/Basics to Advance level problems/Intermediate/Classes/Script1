b ; so what do we have here doctor

h ; your suspicions were correct he dies from drug overdose but not just any amount of it either a very lethal dose was injested

b ; but his classfellows said he was normal the whole morning and he did not do anything suspicios either.

h ; the thing is he did not injest any drugs

m ; the thing is we found about 4 kilos of drugs in his body after thorough examination

h : and to top it off one ruptured in his body leading to an overdose

m ; this is no normal drug either, after doing a deep research we have found traces of it in brazil

b; so the drugs were tranported from brazil to pakistan?

m: this seems like the work of a quack doctor...

b : this is no small organisation this may turn out to be a huge gang

a ; something is fishy daya *close up*
