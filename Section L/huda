Dear Sir/Madam,

I am writing to express my disappointment with the recent purchase of a bag from your store. On 6 march 2024, I bought a silver bag adorned with sequins and embroidery, priced at £15.99. It was intended for use at my cousin's engagement party later that evening.

However, upon placing my belongings inside the bag, I immediately encountered an issue. The lining tore, rendering the bag unusable for its intended purpose. Despite my mother's attempt to rectify the situation by sewing up the tear, further problems arose when I discovered that some of the sequins had fallen off. This occurrence was highly unexpected and unacceptable, as I believe products sold should meet reasonable quality standards.

Therefore, I kindly request either a full refund of £15.99 or a replacement bag of similar design and quality.I look forward to your prompt response and resolution to this issue.

sincerely,
Grace
